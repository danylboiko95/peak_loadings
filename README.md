# Conclusion

- Implement autoscaling and caching as primary solutions for general news delivery, resolving most performance issues during peak loads.

- Analyze audience numbers and calculate traffic estimates to determine the scale group. Use metrics gathered during various traffic scenarios, including peak events like parallel matches of the Champions League, to guide scaling decisions. Every machine metric and service should be a separate group covering DB, memory, processes, or other combination.

- Anticipate high-traffic events and scale resources in advance to ensure a seamless user experience during global events.

- Establish clusters dedicated to specific countries if news content pertains to those regions. Increase delivery speed and user experience for localized news.

- Cache template pages and use lambda functions to serve news content when peak traffic occurs.

- Create a separate API and server to provide data access to developers, minimizing the load on the user site. This can be monetization, for example offering paid subscriptions for faster data access and providing free access with latency.

- Plan responses and scaled groups based on different countries to optimize content delivery and server resources.

- Consider the option of posting news gradually, targeting different regions as needed. Divide users into groups and deliver news to each group if instant information delivery is not critical.

- Set up a separate API for bots and scores data to ensure efficient data access while maintaining server performance.
